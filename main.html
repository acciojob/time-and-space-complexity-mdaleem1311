	<h1>Time and Space complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows.The efficient algorithm is often evaluated by its Time complexity, which indicates how the runtime grows relative to the input size, and its Space complexity, which indicates how memory usage grows. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It helps assess how the memory requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases in O(1), O(n) etc.,</p>
